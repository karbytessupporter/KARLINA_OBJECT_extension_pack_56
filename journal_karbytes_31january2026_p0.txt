I noticed that, within two days of getting the (gasoline, pre-2000s) car back (which legally belongs to my parents but which primarily I am or have been using to commute to work/events since late 2025) from the repair shop that "my" car has a consistent "check engine" light again. It seems I'm being pressured into losing my job due to car breakdown and, also, with having little to no use of the car as a private vehicle for karbytes to use. To be on the safe side, karbytes plans on transitioning to mostly if not exclusively walking/biking/BART/bus/ride_share to/from the work site (and packing for possible overnight camping in the baylands when BART is closed).
